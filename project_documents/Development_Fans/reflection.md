# Development_Fans Reflection

## Design

I closely followed my design document after the review was completed.

## Project
I used strategies to try to find answers from other people who already 
had the same problem.

I solved my problems by trying to find answers on the Internet. 
I have also tried various programming methods to solve the problem.

## Scrum

I estimated the amount of work on the project almost exactly.

## Looking ahead

I gained a good experience that will help me in my work, later units, the capstone,
and my internship.
